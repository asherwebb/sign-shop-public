<p>Wow! You actually made it to the bottom? We&#8217;re impressed. Sorry about all the legalese and the occasional screaming, bold, all-caps text. We keep trying to get our legal team to write stuff in normal, everyday English, but they insist that they went to law school in order to show off their superior vocabularies, to use their rudimentary knowledge of Latin, and to mystify the general public with their incomprehensible prose. The rest of our site is much more enjoyable. Check it out and let&#8217;s go make some beautiful signs.</p>
